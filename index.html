		<p>After discussing each other’s tests, they were summarised in the above table. The first thing that stands out from the summary, is that we each have a different Myers-Briggs profile. This means that each of us has unique styles, preferences, strengths, and weaknesses. We were able to find our places in the team quickly, and the more interaction we had, the easier it was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each member. Overall, it is a benefit to have different personalities on the team, as it helps with the diversity of thinking and approaches.</p>
		<p>On the learning test, the results were mostly visual or logical, with one pragmatist. This meant that for our team meetings, we could and did use visual aids such as screen sharing, diagrams, charts, and step-by-step instructions relating to group work. We also helped each other by working on sections through collaboration and reviewing each other's work. The Office 365/Teams collaboration capabilities were very useful in this regard, including the ability to record meetings. Due to different personal, work and university demands for each member, not all members were able to attend every meeting. Those that missed a meeting could easily watch the recording and the minutes of the meeting to catchup on the outstanding requirements and keep up with the group discussions.</p>
		<p>Another useful part of Teams Meetings was that most members had their webcams on (unless at work or on the go). This helped us relate to each other better, and read each other’s body language and facial expressions, picking up the undertones and the point the member was making and how it was being received.</p>
		<p>Each member’s final test was slightly different. Most of them did the Big 5 Personality Test, which ranks a person on their OCEAN traits. Another test was the Mind Tools Self-Test, which Jared used. This showed how he was creative, innovative, and sharing in his success, which was supported by the fact that most members of the group liked his project idea and picked it as the team’s idea to work on. The other test was the Leadership Style test, which Alex used. This showed how he was a transformative leader, who not only looks for improvements, but likes to take his team on the journey with him. This was reflected by Alex assuming the leadership, organisation, and co-ordination role within the team.</p>

		<h3>Marcus Broodryk</h3>
		<p>The ideal job for Marcus was a Penetration Tester/Ethical Hacker. To get into this field, you are required to have multiple certifications such as Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP). Some of the responsibilities that come with being an ethical hacker is being able to conduct a wide range of penetration tests and reporting those test results to your clients, such as project managers, service owners and developers. You must also maintain a high level of awareness for advancements in hardware and software technologies. Most of the time you will need to think like an attacker would and have a great understanding of vulnerabilities and penetration testing processes. You will also need experience with programming languages and multiple platforms. These are only some of the expected requirements, and they only scratch the surface of the skills required to be a professional ethical hacker.</p>
		<p>Multiple job listings were reviewed on SEEK (<a href="https://www.seek.com.au" target="_blank">https://www.seek.com.au</a>). This was to get a better understanding on what employers are looking for when it comes to recruiting a penetration tester/ethical hacker.</p>

		<h3>Access Denied Team Jobs Analysis</h3>
		<img src="report/team_job_analysis_1.png" alt="">
		<img src="report/team_job_analysis_2.png" alt="">
		<p>On review of the jobs everyone chose there were two Developer jobs, Solomon’s was more specific to front-end, and Jared’s was more of a software engineer. There were two Cybersecurity jobs – Eric’s was more of a generalist cybersecurity position, while Marcus’ was more specific about Penetration testing. Aidan’s role was to be a Digital Business Analyst. Alex’s role was a CIO. When comparing the different roles, we identified some broad competencies that are required as part of any IT role (separate to the IT Industry analysis, which is further in the report).</p>
		<p>We then summarised them into seven categories and ranked the requirement from 1 to 5 (1 least required to 5 highly required) for various roles. This was put in a table and radar charts, to try and see which best compares the roles. The table was useful when comparing the different competencies between different roles, making it easy to rank against each other. The radar charts show the unique fingerprint of each role.</p>
		<p>Finally, we created a radar chart of all the roles to see what it would show combined. Overall, it showed with the roles selected there is already a good cross section and coverage of the different competencies withing the IT Industry.</p>

		<h3>Aidan Ryan - Digital Business Technical Analyst</h3>
		<h4>Analysis</h4>
		<img src="report/ar_industry_data_1.png" alt="">
		<h4>Analysis Commentary</h4>
		<p>The role of Digital Business Technical Analyst is a highly specific job title relating to the specific position being advertised by McDonalds. However, when reflecting upon the tasks required by the position, many other job titles with the same or similar day to day requirements were identified. Whilst the McDonald’s position did not appear in the Burning Glass data, similar positions made up 5.9% of total vacancies with the lowest rank of all relevant positions, Solutions Architect, being a rank of 1. In identifying the cause for such high demand, it is to be noted that the position is not a limited management position, but rather a more widely required analytical position that most of the business requires to determine IT needs and opportunities. The higher ranking over other positions such as developers is due to the solutions architect being able to create new solutions with already existing software at many organisations.</p>
		<p>Using the specific position description for my ideal job, Digital Business Technical Analyst, and the position descriptions for similar positions as identified above, the top skill requirements have been identified. Split into three categories; general, IT specific and programming, the skills identified highlight the more analytical nature of a solutions architect or business analyst with critical thinking and analytical skills being of higher necessity than other more technical skills with administrative, analytic and communicative skills being of higher relevance than specific programming or technological knowledge. This meets expectations as the role is analytical and architectural in nature: to identify from a high-level perspective the ideal system, rather than having intimate technical understanding as you would from a development perspective.</p>
		<img src="report/ar_industry_data_2.png" alt="">
		<p>From the general skills data analysis, it can be identified that critical thinking is a primary skill required for the position which complements the analytical nature of the role. In near equal share behind this, are the skills of organisation, problem solving, communication and troubleshooting which complements the primary skills behind the role. Although the role is responsible for the identification and specification for required IT solutions, it is not a primary management role, and therefore there is a limited focus towards management skills and strategic planning, rather the resolution of issues as part of a higher managers strategic plan.</p>
		<img src="report/ar_industry_data_3.png" alt="">
		<p>Regarding IT specific skills, the position descriptions identify a similar type of skill set as the baseline skills – one orientated around a surface level of knowledge and understanding but grounded in specification, analysis and communication. It would be expected for this role that a working knowledge of all systems exists, but not significant technical experience with all. Given this, the top 10 required skills only account for 10% of IT skills, denoting the more specialised and less mainstream technical nature of the role.</p>
		<img src="report/ar_industry_data_4.png" alt="">
		<p>The specific programming skills required are varied and give an impression of a deep technical knowledge. However, it is notable that a working knowledge of many of these systems is all that is required. Of specific note, however, is Jira and other CRM software’s, which are specifically listed as core elements of the role. These meet the expectation of the role, analytical and solution coordination orientated rather than deeply technical.</p>
		<p>Although a wide variety of skills all relating to the position were found to be elements of the positions, not all top IT skills were noted. Specifically, for the baseline skills, writing, planning and creativity were the top three skills not explicitly noted with an average rank of 7. These skills are an implicit pre-requisite for the position and are covered in majority by other skills listed, namely communication and critical thinking. In both IT specific and programming skills, similar top 3 missing skills were identified. These were JavaScript, OS (Windows and Linux) and then a second language / system (.NET and Java). For the position being analysed, these skills are not intimately required – it is not a software development position and would be covered by the developers of the architect's solution, not the architect themselves.</p>
		<h3>Alex Nikoliouk - CIO</h3>
		<h4>Analysis</h4>
		<img src="report/an_industry_data_1.png" alt="">
		<h4>Analysis Commentary</h4>
		<p>CIO roles and similar type (CTO, Head of IT, GM of IT) are quite rare, with the lowest rank of a role in that bracket is rank 77, overall CIO and similar roles only make up 1.1% of total Job Vacancies based on the data provided. This makes sense as the role looks after the IT team and represents it in the organisation. Similarly, this role has the most amount of responsibility, generally answering to the CEO and the Board, around the operations of IT and ensuring the IT requirements are in line with the overall organisational strategy.</p>
		<p>Based on Burning Glass data, and Seek job ads, the top skill requirements for IT professionals that are also required for a CIO are Communication Skills, Problem Solving, Organisational Skills, Teamwork/Collaboration, Windows and Building Relationships. Except for Windows, the other skills are more general and soft skills. CIOs are expected to know technical skills, but their main requirement is to lead teams and work with various stakeholders including other executive team members and the board. The technical skills required for a CIO are general in nature, as their teams will be looking after the technical aspects of IT for the business.</p>
		<img src="report/an_industry_data_2.png" alt="">
		<p>Reviewing the specific skill sets around General, IT Specific and Programming, General skills revolve around people, team management and strategic thinking. Communication Skills are the most required skill sets for IT professionals, but skills like Decision Making, Strategic Planning and Critical Thinking are lower ranked for IT professionals but required for this position due to the specialised strategic leadership nature of the CIO role.</p>
		<img src="report/an_industry_data_3.png" alt="">
		<p>For IT specific skill requirements, the soft skills also dominate the demand with specialised skills like Technical Industry Knowledge, Information Systems, Business Communications, Security and Organisational Development included. Showing a much more specialised nature of the role, with the top 10 skills only accounting for 8.5% of the IT Specific skill sets sought.</p>
		<img src="report/an_industry_data_4.png" alt="">
		<p>Programming is similar to IT specific, with general IT knowledge skill sets around ERP, SaaS, VPN and Microsoft products required, as the role will unlikely be doing much programming if any, rather the coordination of development teams, which will be a subset of teams being looked after by the role. Other teams would be the infrastructure team, maybe a security team (depending on the organisation), BI team, web development team etc.</p>
		<p>Some of the missing skills were either assumed, or not specifically required for the role (while still desirable, they will not define the role). For example, the General writing, troubleshooting and planning skills are likely an assumed pre-requisite for the seniority of the role. While the IT Specific and Programming skills (SQL, JavaScript, Java) will likely be covered by CIOs team.</p>
		<h3>Eric Sandberg - Cyber Security Manager</h3>
		<h4>Analysis</h4>
		<img src="report/es_industry_data_1.png" alt="">
		<h4>Analysis Commentary</h4>
		<p>Based on the analysis and the data provided, Cyber Security Manager or similar roles makes up 1.8% of total job vacancies. As the job requires several years of experience and specific skill sets, this does not come a surprise. Generally, the role is the head of the cyber security department and are reporting to the CEO of the company or other Manager’s in the IT operations.</p>
		<img src="report/es_industry_data_2.png" alt="">
		<p>By reviewing the different skills required for the position based on the Burning Glass data and job advertisement, the top skill requirements were Communication skills, Problem Solving, Organisational skills, Teamwork/Collaboration. A Cyber Security Manager need to have a strong knowledge in Open Security Architecture frameworks, stay update with the latest Technology and trends. Show specific experience and knowledge in security legislation and industry standards. A manager needs to show strong leadership and develop and maintain a strong relationship with internal and external teams.</p>
		<img src="report/es_industry_data_3.png" alt="">
		<p>When analysing the specific skill set for Cyber Security Manager the general IT skills sets are required. For this role Network Hardware and Information on Security is specific skill sets that are lower ranked but essentials for this position. More general IT skill set like .NET Programming, Building Relationship and security system are ideal as well. Common requirements for a manager position include Communication skills, Team orientation and management, strong leadership and strategic thinking and planning.</p>
		<img src="report/es_industry_data_4.png" alt="">
		<p>The specific programming skills required are JavaScript, SQL, JAVA, Python and Net programming to name a few. As you oversee the Security infrastructure of an organisation a broad knowledge in IT is a must. It is very important that you are up to date with the latest's technology and cyber security trends. When analysing the data and the job advertisement some skill sets were not listed but rather assumed, for example verbal and written skills and people orientated.</p>
		<h3>Jared Johnston – Senior Software Engineer</h3>
		<h4>Analysis</h4>
		<img src="report/jj_industry_data_1.png" alt="">
		<h4>Analysis Commentary</h4>
		<p>Based on the analysis and the data provided, Senior Software Engineer or similar roles makes up 8.6% of total job vacancies. As the job requires five years or more of experience in specific skill sets and environments. The role is tasked with overseeing product support, installation, and deployment duties. However, role is expected to provide high-end experience and knowledge based on the roles desired skill sets.</p>
		<img src="report/jj_industry_data_2.png" alt="">
		<p>By reviewing the different skills required for the position based on the Burning Glass data and job advertisements, the top skill requirements were Communication skills, Problem Solving, Organisational skills, Teamwork/Collaboration. A Senior Software Engineer needs to have a strong knowledge of computer programming and coding, this includes a high knowledge of Software development and Object-Oriented Design. As the role promotes assisting other employees experience in testing and debugging software is highly desired along with problem-solving and the added asset of being a logical thinker is a desirable trait.</p>
		<img src="report/jj_industry_data_3.png" alt="">
		<p>When analysing the specific skill sets for Senior Software Engineer general IT skills sets are required as role or by company. Most roles are seen to be advertised with common highly desirable skill sets that reflect the pie graph to the left. SQL and C syntax languages are usually the most sought out and then other broken down into specific as per role skills from mainframe .NET or Linux experience or cloud-based Microsoft Azure, AWS, and the like.</p>
		<img src="report/jj_industry_data_4.png" alt="">
		<p>Specific programming skills required are general as per company requirements for specific roles. However, general programming skills found during researching roles are SQL, JAVA, Linux (CLI) and Python with major languages falling into specific job roles that require a certain programming language.</p>
		<h3>Marcus Broodryk – Penetration Tester</h3>
		<h4>Analysis</h4>
		<img src="report/mb_industry_data_1.png" alt="">
		<h4>Analysis Commentary</h4>
		<p>Based on the data I have received from the Analysis, there was no exact job title for the Ethical Hacker or Penetration Tester so going by similar jobs with the same skill set I found that 2.1% of total vacancies were found for the selected jobs such as Security Analyst, Security Architect and Security Consultant. Works fields such as Security Analysts such as monitoring security audit and intrusion detection system logs for system networks. Investigating and/or escalating security violations and attempts to gain unauthorized access, virus infections that may affect the network or other even affecting security.</p>
		<img src="report/mb_industry_data_2.png" alt="">
		<p>Based on the Burning Glass data, some of the general skills that came I across were communication skills, problem solving and planning. These were the top 3 skills were the general skills for these required jobs. For roles such as security Analysts, communication skills are a huge asset to the role because you are required to always communicate with your clients or peers without working processes. Problem solving is also an important must have skill, there is a lot of tasks when problem solving comes to play within being in these types of roles. Lastly planning always comes to play when proceeding to do work on the daily basis in the Cybersecurity work fields.</p>
		<img src="report/mb_industry_data_3.png" alt="">
		<p>Reviewing the skills for the IT Specifics I have come across having Cisco, Firewalls and Computer Hardware / Software Knowledge as the top 3 skills required specifically for these roles in Cybersecurity. Although system and network configuration, network security and information security are not the top skill sets for the IT specific skills, it is still essential to have these skills for the field of work. For a role such as Security Analyst having these types of skill sets is especially important to maintain efficient process.</p>
		<img src="report/mb_industry_data_4.png" alt="">
		<p>The top required programming skills are SQL, JavaScript, java and .NET Programming. As a Security Analyst and similar types of roles in this field there is a must to have a broad knowledge on these types of programming languages. During security breaches and vulnerability checks through some penetration processes, a lot of programming is used such as shown on the pie graph.</p>
		<p>Throughout the industry data there has been a few skills that were not shown upon the charts because they are more expected already then required such as organisational skills, writing skills and teamwork/collaboration skills.</p>
		<h3>Solomon Bovolos – Front-End Developer</h3>
		<h4>Analysis</h4>
		<img src="report/sb_industry_data_1.png" alt="">
		<h4>Analysis Commentary</h4>
		<p>The front-end developer is a very common job, with one of the highest rankings at number 6 in the Burning Glass data, and a total vacancy percentage of 5.9. Front-end developers are responsible for implementing the elements in websites and web applications that end users see and interact with. They will typically work with back-end developers, who integrate the work of the front-end developer with server-side applications, and clients, to work on a solution that meets the customer's needs.</p>
		<p>Front-end developers are highly sought after, due to their crucial role for developing the interfaces for businesses. They have a high level of experience with standard web technologies, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and web APIs, such as DOM, Fetch and Web Storage API. They may also work with development tools such as version control systems, build tools, and CI/CD pipelines.</p>
		<img src="report/sb_industry_data_2.png" alt="">
		<p>Some of the most common skills required for a front-end developer are communication skills, problem solving, and organisational skills. These are the highest ranked soft skills coming in at positions 1, 2 and 3, respectively. A front-end developer needs good communication skills when working with other developers, problem solving skills for developing solutions for customers and organisational skills for creating and managing teams.</p>
		<img src="report/sb_industry_data_3.png" alt="">
		<p>Reviewing the requirements for a front-end developer position resulted in the top skills being software engineering, technical industry knowledge, and systems engineering. All of these are important skills to have as you will be building software tooling, libraries, and frameworks. Other skills listed are web application development and software analysis. Again, these are required skills as your work revolves around creating websites and web applications, as well as testing and analysing the software that you develop.</p>
		<img src="report/sb_industry_data_4.png" alt="">
		<p>The top skills for a front-end developer are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are all high-ranking skills and are technologies that all front-end developers need to have experience in. User interface design is also another very important skill to have, as you will be designing the interfaces for websites and web applications. Having experience with Linux, PHP, and JSON are also good skills to have as you may be using APIs in your software, depending on the project you are working on.</p>
		<p>This role is a typical IT position, with a high percentage and high-ranking skill set. Some of the missing general skills are writing, troubleshooting, and detail orientation, which are expected of any developer. Some other missing skills such as SQL, Java and C# would be better suited for other positions such as a back-end developer.</p>
		<h3>Team Industry Data – Analysis</h3>
		<img src="report/team_industry_data_1.png" alt="">
		<p>Some of the Ideal roles in this group are quite specialised, making up 2% or less of the overall job listings. This is both a positive and a negative when looking for roles. Those that will pop up will be more competitive to get into, but at the same time, they should also remunerate better due to the speciality of the role.</p>
		<p>The more prominent roles would still be competitive, as more people are likely to specialise into those roles. Ultimately the people that will succeed in those roles, will be the ones that are able to demonstrate the desired skill sets for the roles.</p>
		<p>Off the General skills the top 2 (Communication and Problem Solving) were required in all of the Teams roles. Organisational Skills, Teamwork and Planning were the next most important skills appearing in 4-5 of the roles.</p>
		<img src="report/team_industry_data_2.png" alt="">
		<p>IT specific skills were a lot more distributed between the roles, with Building Relationships and Information Security being the only ones that appeared in 3 of the chosen roles, while the others appeared in either 1 or 2 of the 6 roles.</p>
		<img src="report/team_industry_data_3.png" alt="">
		<p>For Programming, some of the standout skills included SQL, JAVA, and Python. SQL representing the ubiquitous requirement of data storage in all parts of the industry, while JAVA and Python representing the current popularity of those two languages.</p>

		<img src="report/it_work.png" alt="">
		<p>For this section of the report, team Access Denied was able to source John Bui, an Applications Architect Manager, for the interview. He works in an internal IT team for Dexus, an ASX Top 50 property management company, with about $32 billion worth of property under management (Dexus, 2020). His job at Dexus is a combination of Project Work and Business as Usual (BAU). To fulfil his responsibilities, he manages a team of developers as well as teams of external contractors, his success factor is implementing processes and structures around his team and applications.</p>
		<p>He is responsible for leading the process of design, selection, and implementation of all internal applications (except of the ERP – which is managed by a separate team). His selection criteria are that the applications must fit the business strategy as relayed to him by the steering committee, which is ran by the executive team. To understand the scope and broader business requirements he runs internal workshops, vendor selection processes as well as engages in constant stakeholder management to ensure everyone is aligned.</p>
		<p>He is ultimately responsible for signing off decisions such as how to structure the data, what data is captured and how it integrates with the other systems. Some of his considerations include maximising the value for the investment Dexus makes forward planning to validate current decisions based on future expected outcomes and ensuring the solutions can be enhanced down the line. John’s BAU application management, apart from bespoke solutions designed for the company, also off-the shelf style products such as Office 365, SharePoint, Teams etc.</p>
		<p>Part of his work having to interact, communicate and manage with various internal and external stakeholders. He interacts with his team the most. He must manage the people within the team, ensure he has the right resources available to him for BAU and Projects that he is undertaking and that the team is trained in the required tools and technologies. The applications team is part of a wider IT team at Dexus which includes sub-departments like Reporting and Analytics team, who must use the data from the applications John implements, the infrastructure team who manages the infrastructure stack he deploys the apps to. He also works with the ERP team, as many of the solutions he implements either pull data from or populate data in the ERP system. The other two IT teams at Dexus are, Smart Buildings team and the Digital (website, social media). He has less interaction with them, as their dealings rarely overlap. John works closely with the executive team through steering committee meetings to understand their strategic vision and educate them on the resources required to implement their vision.</p>
		<p>John described the other departments in Dexus as his clients, who he constantly interacts with, as the solutions he develops and deploys are generally designed for the other departments to use. At the end of the interview John explained that even though the company ASX top 50, with a large IT team and over 500 employees, he enjoys working there because it still operates like a smaller company, agile and community based. Both he and his developers can interact with the end users daily. This also helps with responsibility and accountability since the end user can complain about issues directly to the developer.</p>
		<p>John also has external stakeholders, these include the software vendors, contractors, and external IT auditors. He engages, negotiates, and coordinates the contractors and selected vendors and their solutions. Dexus IT, goes through multiple IT audits annually as part of the ASX compliance requirements and their property fund management requirements. Key requirements of the audits are to test the data movements, security behind the movements, compliance, and any specific investor requirements.</p>
		<p>While at work, John spends most of his time communicating with the different stakeholders of his projects and BAU work. Both formal and informal communication is critical for his success in his role. He attends steering committee meetings with executive team regularly. He talks to his internal customers daily in hallways and breakout rooms. He interacts daily with his team, to ensure they prioritise their time in line with his and the organisations expectations. Apart for ongoing communication, John spends most of his time on planning, coordinating, and executing various applications project work.</p>
		<p>The project work at Dexus involves around process improvement and creating or insourcing bespoke solutions. Due to the size and complexity of the business there are no off-the-shelf software products that exist that can accommodate to its workflows, hence the requirement for the applications team. The remaining part of his time is taken up by BAU work, which is maintaining and supporting existing applications and solutions. He coordinates his team to ensure the existing systems are compliant with organisational requirements, as well as doing small continuous improvement work.</p>
		<p>The most challenging part about John’s work is time management. Due to the volume of work around projects and BAU, he is unable to complete everything perfectly. He is therefore forced to at times cut corners to get things working with not perfect documentation, or functionality, while still meeting all the critical organisational and IT audit requirements. This is a daily challenge, which he is never able to overcome, but at the same time, due to his experience, he knows at what point “good enough” is sufficient for everyone’s needs.</p>
		<p>The COVID-19 pandemic impacted all industries and in 2020. Dexus was no exception. Being a major commercial landlord in Australia, they had emergency pandemic regulations forced on them by the government. Regulations imposed was that the landlords were unable to evict tenants affected by the pandemic. To John, the essence of IT was the project to allow Dexus fulfil its obligations, while protecting the investor’s interests. Since Dexus is a landlord, they had to implement systems and process around this legislative requirement to be compliant, but also maintain their rights and look after their investors interest, by not giving away revenue where possible. It was a fine balance of understanding everyone’s requirements (legal obligations, financial analysis of the impact, record keeping of client interactions and workflows around reviews and approvals of client proposals).</p>
		<p>At Dexus this was coordinated by John’s team as they were tasked with developing the system that would not only do all the above but talk to their existing systems to read and save data. Part of IT work as seen in Burning Glass data is to communicate. IT must align with the organisation’s strategy, or convey to organisational leaders, any changes required within IT to help that alignment. During 2020 John’s team was at the forefront collecting requirements, designing solutions all via an agile process to meet the new landlord requirements as part of the pandemic crisis.</p>

		<h3>Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
		<h4>What are Autonomous Vehicles?</h4>
		<img src="report/autonomous_vehicles_1.png" alt="">
		<p>A fully autonomous vehicle (AV) uses inbuilt and external sensors to perform required operations without human involvement. The operations of a fully autonomous vehicle mimic those of a human, and do not require human intervention to perform correctly even in the most complex situations, therefore distinguishing them from mere automation (Taeihagh & Si Min Lim, 2018). The obvious difference to the current state is that autonomous vehicles do not require a human driver. The more complex design behind AVs is the complex interaction between artificial intelligence (AI), sensors and big data to analyse information, adapt to changing situations on the road (Taeihagh & Si Min Lim, 2018). The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) International in 2014 issued the SAE J3016 standard defining the full range of levels of Automated Level. It has subsequently made several revisions with the latest being revised in April 2021. Below is a summary of the automation levels from the standard (SAE International, 2021). As can be seen in the graphic there are 6 levels of autonomous vehicles, ranging from Level 0 of no driving automation, where the driver performs the entire dynamic driving task to Level 5 where the is sustained and unconditional performance by autonomous driving system of the entire dynamic driving task, with no expectation that the user will need to intervene (SAE International, 2021).</p>
		<img src="report/autonomous_vehicles_2.png" alt="">
		<p>While the end goal of AV manufacturers is the same, Level 5 fully automation. Waymo uses high resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging) and a way of estimating distances to objects by bouncing light off those objects (Piper, 2020). Tesla’s self-driving system uses a forward radar, a forward-looking camera, 12 long-range ultrasonic sensors placed around the car. It uses the camera to identify obstacles ahead of it, the radar detects moving objects ahead of the car including vehicles, bicycles and people, and the ultrasound sensors can sense objects in a 360-degree view around the car at any speed at up to 5 meters away, helping the car calculate any obstacles or hazards and their direction (Thompson, 2016). Most industry players use a slightly different combination of cameras and sensors for the cars to see, as there is not proven and established best practice for ways to make the cars “see”. It is clear though, that the cars will be able to visualise a full 360-degree picture around them when they are on the road, which is much more than what the human can ever perceive. One of the obstacles in developing AVs is training the AI that is used to interpret the massive volume of data that the AV collects from all its sensors. The data is multiplied by millions of magnitudes as it is collected from all the AVs and semi-AVs currently on the road and sent to data repositories to be reused in training new and improved Ais (IEEE Innovation at work, 2021). AV technology is not just for cars, it is already in use in many industries which have much more controlled environments, which have much lower unexpected situations than public roads. Some examples include Sydney Metro autonomous trains, Amazon warehouse autonomous picking systems, autonomous mining haulage systems in mines and others.</p>
		<p>Predictions from 2016 had up to 70% of all distance being driven by autonomous vehicles by 2035, while more recent predictions are more reserved 20% of the distance driven will be by autonomous vehicles by 2040 (Anderson, 2020). These differences are so varied due to the recent challenges experienced and strategic shifts AV developers made due to the difficulty of developing a fully autonomous in any conditions Level 5 vehicle. They are now focusing on more realistic Level 4 autonomous which are available in certain geographic locations and under specific conditions (Anderson, 2020). Some of the challenges AV manufacturers experience include lack of consensus on the end goal of AV technology, lack of current data that can be utilised to train AI, lack of connectivity between vehicles of different manufacturers (Wiggers, 2020).</p>
		<p>There are some key technologies that are behind AVs, and improvements in these technologies will get AVs closer to public roads (MIT Technology Review Insights, 2019). The application of AI is a major focus as it is a key factor in distinguishing autonomous with automated. AI needs to be the decision maker in place of humans, and such it needs to be developed enough to make the right decisions in all AV scenarios. AI market is responding to this need, with the AV AI market expected to reach $10.5bn globally by 2025 (Markets and Markets, 2017). Security is another technology that will need to keep up with the rapid development of AVs. Protection against hacking of self-driving vehicles is key to ensuring widespread take-up. It is estimated the AV cybersecurity market will grow to $5.77bn by 2025 (Markets and Markets, 2020). Network infrastructure is another prerequisite improvement that needs to occur to propagate the growth of AVs. This could be in the form of 5G, low earth communication satellites or other high bandwidth networks enabling a wide range of services such as videoconferencing, health care capabilities, monitoring, gaming and others. Additionally, while the AV technology is expected to largely reside onboard the vehicle itself, AVs will still require communicating with their surroundings, both vehicle-to-infrastructure for operating within the bounds of speed limits, traffic lights and signage, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication to permit safe operations within general traffic situations preventing collisions and near misses (MIT Technology Review Insights, 2019). Finally, the sensor technology is rapidly evolving to meet the demands of AV operations. The sensors and image recognition from deep-learning techniques created the capability of piecing together a high-fidelity model around the AV.</p>
		<p>AV represents a seismic shift in technology, like moving away from horse and cart to cars did in the early 1900s.  This shift will represent the cessation of many existing supporting industries for the current transportation system, as well as the expansion and creation of new industries (Ohio University, 2020). Many existing car manufacturers are anticipating this and are working to keep up with the change, while new entrants like Waymo and Uber are looking to capture market share during the growth phase.</p>
		<h4>Technology Impact</h4>
		<p>Safety is generally discussed in both positive and negative fashion when talking about AVs. In United States the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), compiles information and publishes reports on traffic accidents. In their 2015 report of the 2.2m traffic accidents, 94% or 2.05m were attributed to driver related reasons such as recognition error (inattention, distractions), decision error (speeding, illegal manoeuvre), performance error (overcompensation, poor direction control), and non-performance errors (sleep). The next highest was to vehicles themselves of 2% or only 44,000. This cause was attributed through visual inspection of the vehicle at the scene. For visual identification of vehicle problem, the issue would be pre-existing and would likely be related to maintenance (NHTSA, 2015). The benefit of AVs in most of the above statistics would be that they do not get tired, angry, frustrated or drunk. You can program them to correctly obey the rules and conditions of the road. The sensors allow AVs to evaluate not only what is in front of them, but all around them. They can rely on more sensors than humans, visual, ultrasound, radar, lidar, GPS, vehicle-to-vehicle as well as vehicle-to-infrastructure communications and others. Additionally, AVs maintenance would be stricter controlled by the manufacturers and operators as the AVs could be locked down to prevent operations outside of maintenance windows.</p>
		<p>The main safety concerns relating to AVs at present involve unknown situations, which AI is unable to interpret and make decisions on, “Trolley problem” thought experiments around greater good decision making. That is can we program the AI to make a least bad decision in a situation that has multiple bad outcomes, and if we can, who gets to decide what that decision should be? Security is another main safety concern with AVs. We have seen even highly secure systems successfully breached. Convincing users as well as keeping the promise that AVs will be secure from hackers is a great undertaking.</p>
		<p>Other impacts include but not limited to the following. Parking spaces will disappear or change how they are used. We will no longer require parking at our destination, rather drop-off and pickup points, as the vehicle will be able to park itself. The act of finding a parking spot and parking has been estimated to take up around 30% of total drive time. Another AV model that is being considered is the rideshare model. It is predicted that car ownership will drastically decline and rideshare models will take over. It is estimated that the average person uses their car ~3% of the total time they own it. This creates great value proposition for prospective fleet owners of the cars, who may end up the manufacturers themselves. If they can extract the same price for the vehicle, but share it across up to 30 other people, the cost of sales will proportionately decrease. Furthermore, the complementary industries around the private vehicle can be insourced back into the manufacturer, allowed them to capture additional margin from the broad supply chain. For example, in the user pays, or Car as a Services (CaaS) model, there is no more need for dealerships, as people can test the services with a small cost of a fare, mechanics, petrol stations, car washes etc. disappear as recharging and maintenance will be done in the fleet owners hubs. Consumer motor insurance will disappear as the number of accidents is expected to dramatically decline, meaning insurances will be taken out at corporate level, or even be self-insured. Parking stations will no longer be required as vehicles will go either into roaming mode waiting for the next fare or go to the nearest fleet hub for charging and maintenance (Ohio University, 2020).</p>
		<p>Convenience will be one of the greatest positive impacts. People who are unable to drive such as disabled (blind, epilepsy, etc.), children and elderly will be able to utilise AVs (TWI, 2021). The various safety measures in the vehicles will mean in time they will likely be able to drive faster than what the current regulations allow. This will in turn increase the urban sprawl creating a geographic shift of populations out of cities and into more regional areas. Since AVs require highly specialised technology and supporting infrastructure the demand for IT professionals will increase, this will include network engineers, infrastructure architects, cybersecurity specialists.</p>
		<p>It is the author’s opinion that as AVs come into ubiquity there will be a net benefit to the society. Travel time will reduce and become more productive; road safety will improve. Kids and disabled will be more mobile. Cars will no longer be bought outright, rather they will be a CaaS model, making them more accessible to more economies. The total cost of ownership will reduce, while the convenience will increase.</p>
		<h3>Cloud services, servers</h3>
		<img src="report/cloud_services_servers_1.png" alt="">
		<p>Cloud computing offers different kind of resources, this can be various things like storage, networking, artificial intelligence, databases to name a few. By providing these, companies or the normal consumer can access what they need, at any time, without basically needing a physical computer service. This makes it more economical and flexible for the consumers. (Zettler, 2021). Customers can pay only for what they use and not spend a lot of money on their own IT infrastructure. (Oracle, 2021)</p>
		<p>Cloud services can target different organization and regular consumers depending on their needs. A public cloud service provider, such as iCloud, delivers computer resources — servers, storage, apps, and so on — through the internet. All hardware, software, and other supporting infrastructure is owned and operated by cloud providers.</p>
		<p>Companies are more likely to use a private cloud. These can either be hosted by a cloud provider or physically located in an organization's on-site data centre. By providing dedicated resources to businesses, a private cloud provides a higher level of protection and privacy than public clouds. Hybrid clouds are a mix of private and public clouds that allows users and business to combine clouds based on their needs. (Zettler, 2021)</p>
		<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, cloud usage has increased higher than expected and will continue throughout 2021. Because of the rapid increase of usage, leading cloud companies like AWS, have seen an escalating percentage in profit. When most of the work force had to implement the work from home policy, businesses were suffering due to the cloud usage were higher than initially planned. Several businesses are currently over budget because of an increase in their cloud usage. In reaction to reduced manpower, issues acquiring data centre facilities, and delays in hardware supply chains, other firms may accelerate their move from data centres to cloud. As the pandemic continues, some businesses may discover that public cloud companies provide a better option. (Luxner, 2021)</p>
		<img src="report/cloud_services_servers_2.png" alt="">
		<p>The current trend for consumers is the use of a multi-cloud strategy. This allows companies to choose different cloud services from different providers. The strategy behind this is because different cloud providers specialise in a certain task than others.</p>
		<p>Cloud services have since its beginning target and offer their services for everyone. The future of the industry though is changing. Companies are starting to verticalized and focus on the consumers specific requirements. It does not come as a surprise for those who have been following the industry, the success of cloud adoption has made it possible to customize cloud technologies for companies’ specific requirements. Leading technology companies like AWS and Azure have been for the last couple of years verticalized and customized cloud services for specific government industries, A few examples are Healthcare and Banking industry. Each of this requires a specialized tool, configurations and security that would not compliment both, therefore a verticalized cloud server can be customized deepening on the business.</p>
		<p>Exploring these vertical cloud products is a foray into specialised business sectors, which necessitates a thorough understanding of the vertical, beyond just meeting compliance standards. Vertical clouds are specialised vehicles that stack cloud technologies, focused on the demands and benefits necessary for enterprises to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Enhance the user and data experience</li>
			<li>Provide crucial business information</li>
			<li>Boost security and dependability</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The advantage of combining cloud applications and components to create a focused solution is a technological degree of efficiency that is difficult to accomplish (and sustain) with a combination of on-premises, hybrid, and third-party technology. It will be difficult to be able to avoid the future of vertical clouds. Businesses will be able to stop bending the cloud to meet business demands and instead convert it into a proposition that is created to meet those goals from the start. (Sayegh, 2021)</p>
		<p>Serverless is another trend that will increase moving forward. It helps businesses to design and deploy applications without having to worry about managing physical infrastructure, which eliminates the need for architectural engineering. Cloud service providers handle all scaling, maintenance, and upgrades in exchange for a reasonable charge. Companies can reduce cost by eliminating physical infrastructure. The downside of this trend is that more people will make redundant as companies do not need to physical manage their IT infrastructure anymore. (Mehmood, 2021)</p>
		<p>Another dominating cloud computing technologies in recent year is artificial intelligence (AI). AI and cloud computing are being seamlessly integrated in the IT industry to improve corporate operations, functionality, and efficiency. It now allows businesses to scale, adapt, manage, and automate their processes with ease. Artificial intelligence can also give additional security to the cloud by detecting and resolving issues before they cause harm.</p>
		<p>Experts believe that, as AI's analytical capabilities improve, systems will be able to perform regular operations fully on their own, freeing up IT professionals to focus on strategic duties that add value and improve service. However, the true savings will come when companies start using data insights to deliver better service, run analysis without human interaction, or implement more efficient procedures that improve the customer experience and the companies. (EZmarketing, 2020)</p>
		<p>As most social media and streaming sites are cloud-based services, this will off course effect most of us including myself. The everyday user will not see any significant effect as the latest trends tend to target companies not the average consumer. With artificial intelligence being integrated into cloud computing I believe that the service will be faster, and this will improve the loading speed when you are streaming movies or tv-shows. Personally, I do not use social media very often so this will not affect my daily life in any way. All though if AI will hence performance when using different streaming platforms, I believe that this can makes a different for me. Sometimes when I stream my podcast’s it can take a bit of time to load. By saying that your streaming platform is also affected by the type of internet service you may have. Personal cloud storage I do not use, even though this will improve with the latest technology personally I will not see any changes. Most likely soon I would need cloud storage but since I never used it before it will be hard for me to compare the difference.</p>
		<p>My wife on the other hand is moving towards cloud storage of photos and videos. Since we have young children, both of us are recording more photos and videos of our family. For a significant time, my wife been wanting to back up the photos and videos. She is worrying in-case her phone stop working that all the data storage will be lost. With this new technology been introduced it would be a good choice for both of us to organize personal cloud storage to prevent an accident from happening. Also, since security will be improved with the latest technology our family will feel more confident to move our personal data towards “the cloud”. Since researching and learning more about cloud computing it is inevitable that we are depending on it more and more. Even though most of us are not aware on the daily effect that cloud services impact or lives. It is important to consider that we are very depending on cloud computing. With the latest technology emerging it will be difficult for any consumer to avoid it.</p>
		<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
		<h4>What does it do?</h4>
		<p>Cybersecurity is the concept or process of preventing and recovering from cyber-attacks on computer systems, networks, devices, and applications. Some of the traditional cyber-attacks are Malware.</p>
		<p>Malware is a term used for malicious software, spyware, ransomware, viruses, and worms. Malware infiltrates a network by exploiting a flaw, such as when a user clicks on a malicious link or email attachment, which then installs dangerous software on the user's computer. These types of things can cause difficult accesses of the network (ransomware). It can also obtain information about the user, transmitting data from a singular hard drive (spyware). Malware can also disrupt certain components of the pc and could make the rendering of the PC unusable.</p>
		<p>Phishing is another known traditional cyber-attack. Phishing is a process of sending fake emails to a user that appears to come from a legitimate source or business. The goal here is to steal any sensitive data such as a credit card or login information, it can even lead to infecting the user's computer with malware. Phishing is becoming a more common threat over the years too.</p>
		<p>Another traditional attack would be a (DDoS) attack. I believe this is the most common one out of most. Distributed-denial- of-services (DDoS) is an attack where it floods a specific network system, server, or networks with traffic to overload a bandwidth which causes it to eventually crash over time. This is a common attack nowadays and can be done easily through-out anyone with access to a computer and a network connection.</p>
		<p>As attackers use new tactics driven by social engineering and artificial intelligence to overcome traditional security safeguards, cyber assaults are becoming a more sophisticated and changing threat to your sensitive data.</p>
		<p>Cybersecurity has always been around since the very first simple days of Firewall which was developed in 1980’s. It is one of the most important aspects of IT when it comes to any sort of organization because it protects all the sensitive data of the business and prevents theft or corruption of data from occurring.</p>
		<p>The reality is that the world is becoming increasingly dependent on technology, and this trend will continue as we bring the next generation of smart Internet-enabled gadgets with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity to our networks and cybersecurity will always be a part of that. (cisco, n.d.)</p>
		<h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
		<p>Cybersecurity impacts a lot of things in our world we live in today. Cybersecurity protects all the ranges from (business.gov.au, 2021):</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Accidental or illegal access</li>
			<li>Corruption</li>
			<li>Theft</li>
			<li>Damage</li>
		</ul>
		<img src="report/cybersecurity_1.png" alt="">
		<p>The world we live in today relies a lot on cybersecurity, if we didn’t have it around and advanced as it is right now organizations wouldn’t be able to defend themselves against breaches and resist from getting targeted by cybercriminals. Not only will organizations be in the risk of this but also the society we live in could be harmed at multiple levels due to illegal access, theft and damage.</p>
		<p>The cost of Cybercrime can get up too massive amounts of money when it comes to global impacts of cybercriminals taking advantage of our new systems and technologies, including hacking services too. Impacts like this can take a toll to about $774 billion on the global economy.  Back in 2018 Australia discovered a report found that the Australian Government made an online reporting platform for these types of impacts leading to cybercrime in 2014, over 114,000 reports have been made since then. (Sadler, 2021)</p>
		<h4>What motivates hackers?</h4>
		<p>One of the main keys of motivation for hackers is the reward in money when things are successful. Hackers can obtain your passwords, bank details or even holding your customers information for ransom and then extracting what they need from it and sell it to other competitors/hackers on platforms such as the dark web.</p>
		<p>Another motivation is challenge. A large group of hackers are motivated by challenges they can come across throughout hacking systems or technologies. Some may do this for recognition from their friends/peers of competitors.</p>
		<img src="report/cybersecurity_2.png" alt="">
		<p>Some hackers form groups of put their skills together to form multiple attacks against the economy. Sometimes they’ll try to embarrass the organizations and even their IT teams that works for the organization. What they try and do is override the security systems and break through it to cause corruption and humiliation to the upper management.</p>
		<p>There are some other hackers who find motivation out of revenge. Sometimes this could lead to extreme cruelty. Hackers will become motivated by anger and directly use their skills to attack another person/company to bring fear upon them.</p>
		<p>Also there has been found that other types of hackers are motivated by the sense achievement. Whether they work in teams or alone they strive to become recognized. Social media is a huge target that can be used for boasting or sharing their achievements from exploits. (KHAGRAM, n.d.)</p>
		<h4>How has the cybersecurity industry grown?</h4>
		<p>Back in 1970’s there was a technologies engineer names “Bob Thomas”. He wrote the code for an incredibly unique program back then that could move between computers that had connection the ARPANET which was the technical foundation of the internet back then.</p>
		<p>The intention of his program was not meant to be in any way malicious, but it had a “cheeky” display message that it would show that said “I'm the creeper, Catch me if you can”. In return to this activity’s teasing, Bob Thomas had a friend and a fellow colleague “Ray Tomlinson.”</p>
		<p>Ray Tomlinson programmed an email to move between computer being able to pick up the “creeper” and delete the creeper of the client's computer. The email would also copy itself in the process of this event as it went. People started to call this the “Reaper”. The creeper was the first computer worm in history and the beginning of the reaper motivated an early programming game.</p>
		<p>In 1989 there was the Morris Worm, creator was Robert Morris. The Morris Worm was the denial-of-service (DoS) attack. It affected around 6000 computers during the attack and only 10% of them were connected at the time to the internet but overtime people have debated over whether it was really 6000 or not.</p>
		<p>Robert Morris, the worm's developer, stated that the worm was created to measure the growth of the internet. The worm, on the other hand, would cause any machine it infected to run much slower. The virus was also capable of infecting the same machine several times, each time slowing it down until it ultimately crashed. The way they fixed this problem back in the day was they would regionally shut down the internet for several days and wait for the work to flush out from the computers before reconnecting it. If we were to do this nowadays, I believe we would get into a whole new pandemic, or everyone would start a purge.</p>
		<img src="report/cybersecurity_3.png" alt="">
		<p>CERTs were the first participants in the cybersecurity sector. CERTs stand for a Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), they are a team that is full of security experts which are liable and responsible for protections against threats and attacks to organizations. In the 90’s while they were able to combat and respond to viruses as they emerged, they were primarily response teams, meaning they couldn’t prevent the epidemics. During this era viruses went extremely viral and developed in multiple rapid rates as they were exposed to the internet.</p>
		<p>People began to realize the potential dangers of viruses, even if they typically had little intention or no aim beyond trolling or creating havoc, it wasn’t long before they developed into trojans, spyware and other sophisticated forms. Antivirus software initially appeared in the market in reaction to the growing threat posed by viruses on the internet. Eventually there were programs developed to identify these types of threats and to execute them from the system information. This were known as antiviruses.</p>
		<p>For about 20 years, the massive antivirus businesses founded in the 90’s controlled the cybersecurity market but since 2014, large, well-developed attacks have created a new challenge requiring more imaginative and creative solutions for people to come up with. An example of one of the attacks that had happened back then was a cyber attacked that was towards the company of “Target”. This attack manages to exploit all the information about the company's customers and manager to receive the details of over 40 million credit cards.</p>
		<p>I believe back then this type of attack would have been simply too sophisticated for any type of cybersecurity would have been able to prevent such thing happening. A lot of giant companies were not prepared for such attacks, this ended up being really alarming to the public.</p>
		<p>From 2014 there has been new developed artificial intelligence, machine learning and behavioural detection have been recruited by new users in the industry for great effects for the future. As cyber assaults change and become more sophisticated, the rapidly increasing cybersecurity sector faces very interesting new challenges ahead of them to combat the ever-present danger of hostile activity with cutting-edge technologies and tactics. (University, n.d.)</p>
		<h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
		<p>Cybersecurity affects me in multiple ways because I am personally always around technology, I spend most of my time throughout the day on my pc. I have a lot of personal data on my pc that I value a lot and cannot afford to lose, cybersecurity helps me protect that data for me from getting breached or stolen by an attacker. Despite using my PC all day, I am always connected to the internet as well, probably 90% of my day evolves me interacting with the internet whether its gaming, researching, or doing my university studies. Also, to mention that my phone that I have on me all the time is always connected to the internet and having it connected to the internet puts it at risk of being able to be attacked in various ways that we will never know if it is happening. Therefore, I think cybersecurity has a massive impact on my daily life. (Tunggal, 2021)</p>
		<p>If cybersecurity did not exist in such sophisticated ways on being able to protect all our data and assets that we have as normal human beings on the day-to-day basis for example our bank accounts, phones or even the place we go to work every day our economy wouldn’t be where it is today. In saying that knowing we have very advanced cybersecurity makes me feel a lot more comfortable knowing I can go on the internet and be able to accomplish the things I need to without being at risk all the time of all the types of cybercrimes out there.</p>
		<p>I believe that cybersecurity would affect my friends and family in the same way as it would personally affect me because we all interact with the internet everyday especially in this generation. From a personal aspect I know we all use social media to contact our friends, family or even our work. Social media is a huge impact on everyone's life. I feel to keep such a massive variety of platforms safe and have everyone's personal information protected, cybersecurity is very important to everyone's daily lives because it keeps us all safe.</p>
		<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
		<p>The systematic and automatic improvement of a computer program in identifying and classifying data or items offers a wide range of opportunities in computer science (Ivanović & Radovanović, 2014). Machine learning has proliferated in its use in day-to-day life, and essential function, especially in its use in the medical fields during the onset of COVID-19 (Code Motion, 2021). The utility of machine learning has expanded from limited classification, to include areas such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision and robotics process automation (RPA).</p>
		<p>In the years immediately preceding 2021, we saw the introduction of Googles BERT algorithm and its utility in NLP. This algorithm, developed by a Google research team in 2018, has already replaced Googles and many other organisations algorithms for NLP in the modern context. Beyond the implications for advancement in the NLP field, the BERT algorithm stands as an example of the implications that modern machine learning have on computational ability (Code Motion, 2020).</p>
		<img src="report/machine_learning_1.png" alt="">
		<p>For most previous machine learning algorithms, supervised learning was the method utilised to allow the algorithm to adjust and learn how to classify the data it received. This method, however, does not work with data sets with unknown or out of context labels, and for that unsupervised machine learning can be employed. Rather than classifying information along a pre-set list of labels, unsupervised machine learning can take blind data (rather than the required data and result for supervised learning) and self-organise a data structure that allows the algorithm to flexibly identify new, or missing context results (Wiggers, 2021).</p>
		<p>The utility of such a data structure as given by unsupervised machine learning offer a different form to classification, clusters, and regression. By giving each element a position relative to other data, it allows the network to form associations with similar data, including that which closely resembles other information, and yet is distinct from it. This is of advantage in medical fields where the introduction of data out of context to that already known, would not allow for accurate determination of results and calculations (Sidey-Gibbons & Sidey-Gibbons, 2019).</p>
		<img src="report/machine_learning_2.png" alt="">
		<p>In addition to unsupervised machine learning, deep learning is also essential to the growth of machine learning potential. Deep learning uses the model of the brain as inspiration and builds a network made from neurons named a neural network. This network can be trained with a large amount of information to give increasingly accurate labels to content. In opposition to older styles of machine learning, also called ‘flavours’, deep learning algorithms (neural nets) continue to see accuracy and performance growth with more data, rather than reaching a plateau like historic flavours. Of note also, is that although early results were noted in supervised training, the enormous amounts of data required, and the large amounts readily available from the internet and other sources allows deep learning to be suited for unsupervised learning (Code Motion, 2021). The fundamental improvements in computing technology and in computational power have single handily been the revolutionising factor in bringing an old hypothesis into fruition for the 21st century and beyond (Brownlee, 2019).</p>
		<img src="report/machine_learning_3.png" alt="">
		<p>Finally, in the discussion of the state of the art of machine learning, its advancements, and the causation of these advancements, is the advent of robotics process automation (RPA). RPA deals not with actual robotics, but with the automation of repetitive tasks within a computer system, examples being rule based and trigger driven copy and paste, file transfer and conversion tasks (Casey, 2020). These tasks encompass a combination of computer vision and machine learning tools that together, provide a not altogether new system or technology. However, as we move into 2021, the knowledge to be gained and technical advancements come not from the technology itself, but for the human interactions with it and the implementation of it into the workplace and world. Of note in this regard, is that the implementation of these tools has and will continue to grow massively, and the outcomes of their utility remain to be seen. It is believed that as they are implemented, the necessity of use, workflow and interactions between other technologies will be explored and give rise to the further advancement of the technology. (Casey, 2020)</p>
		<p>From the development of the machine learning tools discussed above, and those that were not including computer vision, we will see a phase of increased implantation and optimisation. Over the coming years, the application of NLP techniques will continue to allow for the optimisation and development of new ways of interacting with people and machines. Furthermore, advancements in deep learning will be implemented in the big data business environment to provide a machine analysis and finally computer vision coupled with deep learning will continue to provide a platform for work on autonomous vehicles. In summary, we will soon see the optimisation of these systems, and then their implementation in a wide range of fields, replacing current old flavours of machine learning.</p>
		<p>The potential for impact because of machine learning is substantial. From previous implementations of machine learning, we have seen both it provided a role to complement the growth of technology, such as RPA systems – managing the digital data and file environment where one did not exist previously, and in complementary roles, namely providing additional tools for data analysis and classification. We will see continued impact on a wide range of people in a considerable number of industries. It is foreseeable that machine learning will be implemented as a complementary tool in many industries – farming as an analysis tool to identify and resolve potential issues, in transport to create the most efficient packing and routing options available and in medicine to provide a second opinion and potentially in the future, a better diagnosing option. However, it will also act as a replacement or substitute in some industries. In analytics, machine learning could replace the human in analysing data, in data entry, categorisation and administration, machine learning could replace the needed work or in translation, where machine learning could replace the need for translation services. Importantly however, when a level of machine learning and computer vision is reached, the number of tasks that could be automated is significant. The methodology of utilising the model of neurons and a neural network itself implies an attempt to create a structure that mimic the way of human thinking and although it would be unlikely that computation could reach a similar level to the brain in the near future, even a partial similarity in power could enable the systematic automation of many human roles. With such a statement, however, is the caveat that robotics and automation infrastructure are also sufficiently advanced to support the machines learned behaviours. As with many technological developments however, as positions are removed, some others are created in the development and upkeep of the replacing system and in the scenario, also the administration of training for the machine learning platforms.</p>
		<p>In daily life however, the immediate impact is only moderate. As significant technology organisations implement the technology, the impact will increase. An example of this is the BERT algorithm, increasing the accuracy of Google searches, or the use of facial recognition and suggestions of actions given by Apple devices in specific but shared by many other brands. These examples stand to show that for the time being at least, the machine learning in our day-to-day life is complementary – we do not explicitly recognise its existence. It would be a fair assumption to note that very few people had noted Google’s change of algorithm, outside of those who actively monitor such technologies. Furthermore, very few individuals would consider the technology at play behind spam email recognition. An area of note in machine learning to the public, however, has been its use in the determination of, and display of advertising tailored to the individual. However, as a collective, the point is clear that machine learning exists in some form, however diminutive, in many aspects of our lives in 2021. The extent of which, and its apparent nature is the key opportunity for development and extension in the future. In the extreme cases, this technology will affect everyone differently. Machine learning relies on a significant amount of data, and this will be of concern for some people who may choose not to use the technology for this reason. Alternatively, however, machine learning offers automation that many may find useful at home and work. Finally, as noted above, with significant machine learning, some positions will be made redundant, and others will be created. The impact of a world transitioning towards technology highlights the change for many individuals' past, present and in the future – a future guided by machines trained to classify, cluster and present information, decisions and learnings.</p>

		<h1 id="project-idea" class="section-title">
			<a href="#project-idea" class="section-link">Project Idea</a>
		</h1>
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>Our project idea will revolve around creating a video game using the Unity real-time development platform. The platform has a built-in visual scripting system, C# programming environment via Microsoft Visual Studio, and AI interfaces that can be modified using C#. With these utilities, the team will create a gaming environment to cater to the interests of the gaming community at large. To achieve this, the project will bring together ideas on artificial intelligence within a gaming environment and Non-Player Character (NPC) interactions with the player. Our aim is to add value to the gaming market by creating innovative approaches to player interactions in a gaming environment.</p>
		<h3>Motivation</h3>
		<p>The primary motivation for this project idea is to deliver a more interactive gaming experience by implementing artificial intelligence into a gaming environment, with the aim of fostering innovation within the software development industry. In this project, we will develop a game that can interact with the player in exciting ways. A key motivating factor of developing the game is that it will demonstrate how the team can use a Finite-State Machine (FSM) within a video game.</p>
		<p>Standard artificial intelligence concepts are implemented using an FSM, a mathematical model of computation, which can be in exactly one of several states at a time. This allows the game to behave in a predictable manner. The team will first start creating the game environment and focus on making a system that can automatically generate random, yet playable map levels. By utilising Unity’s AI functionality to create thousands of map iterations that are suitable for gameplay, this will allow the team to focus more of their time on developing the rest of the game’s key components, and the visual content.</p>
		<p>Another motivation is to make improvements to the FSM algorithm so that it can understand and adapt to the player’s gaming habits, which can make the game mechanics unpredictable and challenging. It will also show how fundamental AI interactions are the building blocks for more modern and advanced AI concepts such as real-time dynamic reactions and engagements that can deliver a more immersive experience to the player.</p>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>This project idea will be a top-down 3D shooter game that will be immersive, with the aim of demonstrating how artificial intelligence techniques can be combined with mathematics and visual art. The game’s design style and aesthetic will be futuristic, with the game set in the future, and the environment located in the endless depths of space. The player will control an advanced spaceship, and AI-controlled enemy spacecraft will try to destroy the player. There are asteroids and space rocks that the player must avoid while flying to prevent damaging their spaceship. The objective of the game is to reach the safe zone that is located at the end of each map.</p>
		<p>The front end of the game will not be challenging and there is no set difficulty. However, the game will progressively challenge the player by using dynamic difficulty settings and will adjust accordingly to enhance the player's experience. The game’s final development stage will focus on keeping the player engaged and stimulated while playing the game and adapting the gameplay style to be either slow-paced, fast paced, or immersive depending on how the player is engaging with the game.</p>
		<p>Within the back end of the game, the visual scripting systems and FSM algorithms will challenge the player with AI-generated map levels, and unpredictable NPC interactions. The team will then use these techniques to create an innovative game.</p>
		<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
		<p>The project will make use of Unity’s development platform and Microsoft Visual Studio. These programs will require capable hardware to run, requiring decent minimum requirements for storage and graphics, which will be used for developing, rendering, and testing the game. Using both programs will allow the team to create, debug and deploy the finished game.</p>
		<p>To help track changes to source code, GitHub will be used as a version control system and online hosting provider that the team will use to collaborate with each other while developing. Team members will branch off the main branch to work on changes before they are implemented into the main game. Using a cloud-based service to host the source code reduces the risk of the code being accidentally lost or destroyed and allows the team members to work on the project at any time. Members are free to clone the repository and work on their own forks locally, and then push their changes to the main branch when ready.</p>
		<h3>Skills Required</h3>
		<p>The project will require a variety of skills throughout the course of development:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Strong IT skills with experience preferably in software development, graphic design, and game design</li>
			<li>Ability to solve problems, overcome challenges and work on innovative solutions with other team members</li>
			<li>Excellent time management and being able to meet deadlines</li>
			<li>Creativity and the ability to work on new and original ideas</li>
			<li>Excellent communication skills for sharing your visions and ideas</li>
			<li>Teamwork and collaboration skills for working with other team members in a productive and effective manner, and building great relationships</li>
			<li>Genuine interest and passion for playing and working on games</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Further prerequisites for the project's design include knowledge and experience using Microsoft Visual Studio or similar IDEs and being able to write object-oriented programs in C#, or similar programming languages. A good understanding of how in-game mechanics work and experience with developing games using game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine is desired to ensure the team has the knowledge and expertise to work on and deliver a functional, stable, and enjoyable game. Both Visual Studio and Unity are free to download and use, and programmers can be sourced via networking or through the current course that “Access Denied” team members are currently completing, which is “Introduction to Information Technology”.</p>
		<h3>Financials</h3>
		<img src="report/project_idea_financials_1.png" alt="">
		<img src="report/project_idea_financials_2.png" alt="">
		<p>The development of the game and the AI will have some costs associated with it. Staff costs are the most expensive, but similarly will be the least cash flow intensive. The developers will join on an equity basis approach, that is, they will generate options over the term of their employment. The development was based on 6 staff work on getting the prototype to commercialisation stage over 2 years. Other costs are purchasing assets for the game and AI and copyrighted code snippets. The annualised salaries/costs to the business are showed in the “Project Costing - Staff per year” table. The annualised other costs per year are shown in the “Project Costing – Other per year” table. The initial phase before Series A funding can be sought (i.e. when a working prototype is ready), will be bootstrapped from the developers, their families and friends. The initial cash out flows not including the salaries are as per the Total Development Costs table, Expected Cash Outflow line.</p>
		<img src="report/project_idea_financials_3.png" alt="">
		<img src="report/project_idea_financials_4.png" alt="">
		<p>Based on the outflows and the expected returns of the developers, the overall business value at that stage will be ~$2.9m (based on a working and licensable prototype). During Series A, the business will look for ~$2.7m of funding for 48% of the business. This is based on the next 5 years projections which will have the lowest net cash position of ~$2.7m. These 5 years also include cash payments for the original developers as well as additional costs relating to sales/commissions as well as some additional programmer heads. After 5 years from the initial Series A funding it is expected the business will be able to go for Series B, where the original investors (Original 6 and the bootstrappers) will be able to cash on a valuation of $33m based on annual revenue in year 5 of $10m and costs of about $2.5m. The revenue will mostly be generated from license sales of the AI technology as well as some sales for the actual game on the various distribution platforms such as Steam, Epic Games and GOG.</p>
		<h3>Team Roles</h3>
		<p>Each team member will be given a role based on their skills and experience. The team will be split up into the following roles:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Product Manager</li>
			<li>Lead Developer</li>
			<li>Programmer</li>
			<li>Game Designer</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There may be additional roles depending on the scope of the project. For example, the team may decide to add features or new gameplay mechanics that would require the skills and guidance of an expert in that area. While the team members may be able to work on a prototype of that new addition to the game, the team should consider outsourcing individuals, development teams, or companies.</p>
		<p>The team is small, and so collaborating with other team members is crucial to ensure that everyone stays on track and development of the game can continue at a steady pace. Each member will contribute their feedback with one another and share ideas that can be incorporated into the game. Ideas that are not ready can be implemented into a team member’s individual fork of the game source code. If the idea gains approval from all members, then the individual changes can be merged into the main branch. Due to the size of the team, members will need to contribute to parts outside of their expertise as required.</p>
		<p>From there, this cycle repeats and eventually the team will reach a stage where the game has had substantial work put into it. At this point, the game could be ready for an initial beta release that other users can download and test. These users can then provide feedback on what they think of the game, such as what needs improvement and what could be added, changed, or removed. Their feedback can help shape the course of development, and if enough people provide feedback or are interested in the game, this will really motivate the team to continue working on it.</p>
		<h3>Outcome</h3>
		<p>If the project idea is successful, the team will have developed and documented their experiences with AI concepts, real-time development tools, programming, and game design. This can then lead to other ideas and advances with the tools and ideas used throughout the project. The team will have developed a design document that outlines the innovative approaches used in the game design and development process, and what implementations the team used to enhance the various NPC algorithms and player experiences. The design document will also go into detail about the techniques used in the development process, and the reasons why the team chose a particular method or algorithm, how it was used in the game, and how it could be improved or adapted into other games or software products.</p>
		<p>The primary focus of this project idea is not on generating game sales, but at improving the way video games are developed, and to provide additional value and innovation to the game industry in hopes of inspiring others to create innovative games. The project will have met its original design goal by showing that artificial intelligence can be incorporated into a game environment to produce unpredictable behaviour and change the way people interact with games. The game will therefore be a use case to showcase the application of the improved AI technology, that could be utilised in future games, or licensed to third-party development houses to include in their games/technologies. Developers can then take their experience from this project and use it to develop new and creative ways for players to interact within a game environment using artificial intelligence.</p>

		</h1>
		<p><strong>Aidan: </strong>The coordination within the group to complete a significant end product, that took shape steadily over the period of time, was amazing. The collaboration by the group embodied what I imagine the goal of the assessment as a group assignment was meant to be, an environment where we could bounce ideas off each other and all learn from each other's experiences and knowledge to produce an overall greater quality of work. Although we were generally all over the work, we did have a little bit of a last-minute scramble to get everything together. I knew going in that I would be working with a range of people from different backgrounds and experiences, but I was still surprised by how varied and well rounded the group was.  A key takeaway regarding groups would be how being organised going into a meeting makes it much easier to collaborate and not miss anything. Although our commit trail does not indicate it (with the website being the domain of Jared and Solomon), I believe that the group has worked together effectively to deliver a product of equal share and input.</p>
		<p><strong>Alex: </strong>In my opinion the group worked well together. Each person volunteered and contributed to the assignment. Team members were encouraging to others and opinions were freely shared. Our main tool of communication was Teams, where we held meetings between 2 to 3 times a week, we also used Discord as a means of supplementary, informal communication, to get in touch with each other or chat about random things. One thing that could have been done better is completing some of the components of the project sooner, there were some smaller sections of the assignment that were left until the last few days. What was surprising for was that we did not need to share mobile phone numbers with each other. The three communication methods available to us: Canvas, Teams and Discord were sufficient. While not something new to me, as I have had plenty of experience in groups through my past studies and my work experience, this group experience reinforced to me that all groups are different, and the approach will always be different, to succeed the group needs to have a shared vision of the outcome, which we had.</p>
		<p><strong>Eric: </strong>To be honest I was a bit surprised that everything went well. When forming the group, I had no idea what type of people I would end up with and how much everyone would contribute. Because we had a good leader in Alex, the distribution of the workload was very well managed. Everyone had a very good understanding what work they should be doing. In general, I believe the whole assignment went well. Improvement though can always be done, nothing is perfect. Although in general the work got done on time, some last minute adding and adjustment was made. For upcoming assignments, I would like to avoid this and not feel stressful on the due date. Speaking about my own contribution, I should have been a bit more involved to input ideas and speak more during the meetings. The surprising part was that everyone in the group contribute and work well during the whole assignment. What I learned through this group assignment is to be more outspoken, input ideas and thoughts when opportunity is given.</p>
		<p><strong>Jared: </strong>Every group member worked to their strengths and commitments where they were able to and added value to their tasks and other’s tasks through our teams’ meetings or messages. My own personal expectations of working as a team are not high at all even in a day-to-day manner, especially with individuals that I know nothing about. However, in the limited time that we had to gather our thoughts and ideas to present an accomplished assignment 2, we become well organised majority of the time with a few last-minute objectives. Alex brought the team together with his previous experience within group activities, prior studies, and collaboration knowledge. This made the overall group effort ‘hit the ground’ running more effortlessly and without any major confusion, this established a great ice breaker for everyone and strengthened our communication within the team, which was evident at our scheduled Teams meetings that occurred weekly. With Assignment 2 ending I am more than happy with our overall group effort for the assignment and seeing how everyone's strengths, opinions and personalities come can come together to get the task complete on time with only minor hiccups along the way. I established this group early into the course in the hope of gaining team members with similar goals and ideas that would bring together great teamwork and good collaboration to achieve the results we need in this current course.</p>
		<p><strong>Marcus: </strong>Throughout working as a team, we managed to finish what was needed and we were able to complete it efficiently. I feel like our communication overall went well during this assessment for there was not any major problems. We also managed to complete most tasks within incredibly detailed structures with our information we have gathered. Overall, I think we all worked well as a team, and I believe we will do well with the up-coming assessments. Something we could approve on next time as a team for our assessment is finishing all our tasks before it comes to the due date and not leave it to the last minute. One thing I found surprising was how well-organized we were for the most of this assessment, there has been times when I've done group work and it would either be all over the place or nothing would get done. I found that one thing I learned by doing group work is that anything is possible if there is communication within the group. Working in a team can be very 2 sided, it can either go very well or very badly. I am happy to say that this group went very well and the people I worked with are amazing.</p>
		<p><strong>Solomon: </strong>In my opinion, all the team members managed to work very well as a group. The team understood what was required of them and were ready to help if there were any questions, or if someone was unsure of what to do. The collaboration between students was fantastic and it meant that we could all work on our required components together effectively. One of the things that the group could have done a better job at was not leaving things to the last minute. This is not something that anybody should do, however given the complexity of this assessment we all decided to focus more of our time on the more important components. I was surprised at how well we were all able to work together as a group. Going into this assessment, I didn’t know anything about the people that I was going to work with, and it turned out that I had stumbled across an excellent group of people. One thing that I have learned about working in a group is that good teamwork and collaboration can make a world of difference, as team members are able to communicate effectively, share ideas and ultimately work together to get things done.</p>
