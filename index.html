		<p>After discussing each other’s tests, they were summarised in the above table. The first thing that stands out from the summary, is that we each have a different Myers-Briggs profile. This means that each of us has unique styles, preferences, strengths, and weaknesses. We were able to find our places in the team quickly, and the more interaction we had, the easier it was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each member. Overall, it is a benefit to have different personalities on the team, as it helps with the diversity of thinking and approaches.</p>
		<p>On the learning test, the results were mostly visual or logical, with one pragmatist. This meant that for our team meetings, we could and did use visual aids such as screen sharing, diagrams, charts, and step-by-step instructions relating to group work. We also helped each other by working on sections through collaboration and reviewing each other's work. The Office 365/Teams collaboration capabilities were very useful in this regard, including the ability to record meetings. Due to different personal, work and university demands for each member, not all members were able to attend every meeting. Those that missed a meeting could easily watch the recording and the minutes of the meeting to catchup on the outstanding requirements and keep up with the group discussions.</p>
		<p>Another useful part of Teams Meetings was that most members had their webcams on (unless at work or on the go). This helped us relate to each other better, and read each other’s body language and facial expressions, picking up the undertones and the point the member was making and how it was being received.</p>
		<p>Each member’s final test was slightly different. Most of them did the Big 5 Personality Test, which ranks a person on their OCEAN traits. Another test was the Mind Tools Self-Test, which Jared used. This showed how he was creative, innovative, and sharing in his success, which was supported by the fact that most members of the group liked his project idea and picked it as the team’s idea to work on. The other test was the Leadership Style test, which Alex used. This showed how he was a transformative leader, who not only looks for improvements, but likes to take his team on the journey with him. This was reflected by Alex assuming the leadership, organisation, and co-ordination role within the team.</p>

		<h3>Aidan Ryan</h3>
		<p>The ideal job for Aidan was a Digital Business Technical Analyst. This role is synonymous with many others, namely Solutions Architect, Business Systems Analyst, and Implementation Consultant. These alternative job titles allow for the ease of analysis and identification of position openings within the field of positions that have similar roles, skills, and responsibilities. The position is a middle position within an organisation, responsible for analysing gaps determined by senior management as part of strategic plans and creating solutions and specifications for digital solutions. The Solutions Architect is also responsible for sourcing or giving direction to developers to create and implement the digital solutions deemed necessary.</p>
		<p>As an element of reviewing the IT position to determine relevance and feasibility, similar job postings and their required skill sets were identified.</p>

		<h3>Alex Nikoliouk</h3>
		<p>The ideal job for Alex was initially an IT Entrepreneur, but to align with this assignment’s requirements, it was changed to Chief Information Officer (CIO). CIO is a senior management position requiring many years of experience in the industry and has lots of responsibility not only for business IT management, but also for the IT strategic outlook, and pairing it with the overall organisational strategy. This role forms part of an executive team in a company.</p>
		<p>As part of the review, multiple CIO jobs were reviewed on SEEK (<a href="https://www.seek.com.au" target="_blank">https://www.seek.com.au</a>), to get an understanding of the requirements for this position and analyse the key skill sets needed to be both a successful job applicant, and successful at the job itself.</p>

		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>Our project idea will revolve around creating a video game using the Unity real-time development platform. The platform has a built-in visual scripting system, C# programming environment via Microsoft Visual Studio, and AI interfaces that can be modified using C#. With these utilities, the team will create a gaming environment to cater to the interests of the gaming community at large. To achieve this, the project will bring together ideas on artificial intelligence within a gaming environment and Non-Player Character (NPC) interactions with the player. Our aim is to add value to the gaming market by creating innovative approaches to player interactions in a gaming environment.</p>
		<h3>Motivation</h3>
		<p>The primary motivation for this project idea is to deliver a more interactive gaming experience by implementing artificial intelligence into a gaming environment, with the aim of fostering innovation within the software development industry. In this project, we will develop a game that can interact with the player in exciting ways. A key motivating factor of developing the game is that it will demonstrate how the team can use a Finite-State Machine (FSM) within a video game.</p>
		<p>Standard artificial intelligence concepts are implemented using an FSM, a mathematical model of computation, which can be in exactly one of several states at a time. This allows the game to behave in a predictable manner. The team will first start creating the game environment and focus on making a system that can automatically generate random, yet playable map levels. By utilising Unity’s AI functionality to create thousands of map iterations that are suitable for gameplay, this will allow the team to focus more of their time on developing the rest of the game’s key components, and the visual content.</p>
		<p>Another motivation is to make improvements to the FSM algorithm so that it can understand and adapt to the player’s gaming habits, which can make the game mechanics unpredictable and challenging. It will also show how fundamental AI interactions are the building blocks for more modern and advanced AI concepts such as real-time dynamic reactions and engagements that can deliver a more immersive experience to the player.</p>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>This project idea will be a top-down 3D shooter game that will be immersive, with the aim of demonstrating how artificial intelligence techniques can be combined with mathematics and visual art. The game’s design style and aesthetic will be futuristic, with the game set in the future, and the environment located in the endless depths of space. The player will control an advanced spaceship, and AI-controlled enemy spacecraft will try to destroy the player. There are asteroids and space rocks that the player must avoid while flying to prevent damaging their spaceship. The objective of the game is to reach the safe zone that is located at the end of each map.</p>
		<p>The front end of the game will not be challenging and there is no set difficulty. However, the game will progressively challenge the player by using dynamic difficulty settings and will adjust accordingly to enhance the player's experience. The game’s final development stage will focus on keeping the player engaged and stimulated while playing the game and adapting the gameplay style to be either slow-paced, fast paced, or immersive depending on how the player is engaging with the game.</p>
		<p>Within the back end of the game, the visual scripting systems and FSM algorithms will challenge the player with AI-generated map levels, and unpredictable NPC interactions. The team will then use these techniques to create an innovative game.</p>
		<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
		<p>The project will make use of Unity’s development platform and Microsoft Visual Studio. These programs will require capable hardware to run, requiring decent minimum requirements for storage and graphics, which will be used for developing, rendering, and testing the game. Using both programs will allow the team to create, debug and deploy the finished game.</p>
		<p>To help track changes to source code, GitHub will be used as a version control system and online hosting provider that the team will use to collaborate with each other while developing. Team members will branch off the main branch to work on changes before they are implemented into the main game. Using a cloud-based service to host the source code reduces the risk of the code being accidentally lost or destroyed and allows the team members to work on the project at any time. Members are free to clone the repository and work on their own forks locally, and then push their changes to the main branch when ready.</p>
		<h3>Skills Required</h3>
		<p>The project will require a variety of skills throughout the course of development:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Strong IT skills with experience preferably in software development, graphic design, and game design</li>
			<li>Ability to solve problems, overcome challenges and work on innovative solutions with other team members</li>
			<li>Excellent time management and being able to meet deadlines</li>
			<li>Creativity and the ability to work on new and original ideas</li>
			<li>Excellent communication skills for sharing your visions and ideas</li>
			<li>Teamwork and collaboration skills for working with other team members in a productive and effective manner, and building great relationships</li>
			<li>Genuine interest and passion for playing and working on games</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Further prerequisites for the project's design include knowledge and experience using Microsoft Visual Studio or similar IDEs and being able to write object-oriented programs in C#, or similar programming languages. A good understanding of how in-game mechanics work and experience with developing games using game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine is desired to ensure the team has the knowledge and expertise to work on and deliver a functional, stable, and enjoyable game. Both Visual Studio and Unity are free to download and use, and programmers can be sourced via networking or through the current course that “Access Denied” team members are currently completing, which is “Introduction to Information Technology”.</p>
		<h3>Costs/Profits Required</h3>
		<p>The game itself will not cost anything to develop, since the tools that will be used to create the game are free to download and use. However, there may be some optional development costs that the team might pay for, such as assets from the Unity Asset Store, which can range from anywhere between $1 to $100. Due to these prices, assets will be selected on a case-by-case basis and whether that particular asset would fit in with the game’s style and environment. Once complete, the game can be made available for purchase on a variety of online video game distribution services, such as Steam, Epic Games Store, or GOG. This is done to generate revenue from the game, and this revenue will then be used to help the team continue developing the game further.</p>
		<h3>Team Roles</h3>
		<p>Each team member will be given a role based on their skills and experience. The team will be split up into the following roles:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Product Manager</li>
			<li>Lead Developer</li>
			<li>Programmer</li>
			<li>Game Designer</li>
		</ul>
		<p>There may be additional roles depending on the scope of the project. For example, the team may decide to add features or new gameplay mechanics that would require the skills and guidance of an expert in that area. While the team members may be able to work on a prototype of that new addition to the game, the team should consider outsourcing individuals, development teams, or companies.</p>
		<p>The team is small, and so collaborating with other team members is crucial to ensure that everyone stays on track and development of the game can continue at a steady pace. Each member will contribute their feedback with one another and share ideas that can be incorporated into the game. Ideas that are not ready can be implemented into a team member’s individual fork of the game source code. If the idea gains approval from all members, then the individual changes can be merged into the main branch. Due to the size of the team, members will need to contribute to parts outside of their expertise as required.</p>
		<p>From there, this cycle repeats and eventually the team will reach a stage where the game has had substantial work put into it. At this point, the game could be ready for an initial beta release that other users can download and test. These users can then provide feedback on what they think of the game, such as what needs improvement and what could be added, changed, or removed. Their feedback can help shape the course of development, and if enough people provide feedback or are interested in the game, this will really motivate the team to continue working on it.</p>
		<h3>Outcome</h3>
		<p>If the project idea is successful, the team will have developed and documented their experiences with AI concepts, real-time development tools, programming, and game design. This can then lead to other ideas and advances with the tools and ideas used throughout the project. The team will have developed a design document that outlines the innovative approaches used in the game design and development process, and what implementations the team used to enhance the various NPC algorithms and player experiences. The design document will also go into detail about the techniques used in the development process, and the reasons why the team chose a particular method or algorithm, how it was used in the game, and how it could be improved or adapted into other games or software products.</p>
		<p>The primary focus of this project idea is not on generating game sales, but at improving the way video games are developed, and to provide additional value and innovation to the game industry in hopes of inspiring others to create innovative games. The project will have met its original design goal by showing that artificial intelligence can be incorporated into a game environment to produce unpredictable behaviour and change the way people interact with games. The game will therefore be a use case to showcase the application of the improved AI technology, that could be utilised in future games, or licensed to third-party development houses to include in their games/technologies. Developers can then take their experience from this project and use it to develop new and creative ways for players to interact within a game environment using artificial intelligence.</p>
